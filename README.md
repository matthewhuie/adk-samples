# Soundtrack Generator Agent

## Overview

This project provides an agent that generates a soundtrack for an input video.  The agent takes the content and mood of the video into consideration, and leverages music generation using Lyria 2 to create a relevant audio overlay for the video.  This sample demostrates ADK development with TypeScript, multi-agent interaction, tools, and using Google Gen AI SDK.  The output is saved on the user's local disk.

### Key Features
- **Developed with adk-js:** Provides a simple example of an ADK agent written in TypeScript
- **Multi-agent Flow:** Agent interaction involving an orchestrator and several sub-agents
- **Tool using Google Gen AI SDK:** Demonstrates the usage of Lyria 2 via Google Gen AI SDK 
- **Simple I/O:** Uses local disk for input context, and for saving the generated soundtrack asset
